Hey guys! Itâ€™s been about three months since I posted anything here, and I felt like after worlds and my draft leagues had finished it was time to upload my moon and ultra series team report. After a strong Sun Series showing, my Moon and Ultra series results are not nearly as impressive. However, I still earned my worlds invite and worked hard to earn the best results I could at the tournaments I played, and had a lot of fun teambuilding for both formats. This article will go through all of the tournaments I played since the start of Moon series, through to Ultra Series and up to the Pokemon World Championships in Washington DC, which was held on the 16th to the 18th of September, 2019.
