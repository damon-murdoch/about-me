Hey all, I’ve recently discovered this report which I had almost written and published to my blog back in 2016 however it was forgotten and never uploaded. Unfortunately many pastebins have been lost in the past three years, so I've attempted to recover as many as possible without recreating them unauthentically. In additon to this, I’ve tried to more or less leave it as it was as it’s an interesting reflection of my mindset as a player back when it was written. However, I’ve had to rewrite the regionals and nationals sections as they pointed towards a Nugget Bridge report I wrote using the blog system that is no longer accessible. Regardless, I hope you can find some interest in this report and I'd like it to be seen as a kind of time capsule for my development as a player in the later sections, potentially for the format itself.

If you would like to read the full report, please check it out on my Pokemon blog [here](http://sir-scrubbington.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/12/19/221837).
