Hey guys! My name is Damon Murdoch, also known as Sir Scrubbington in the VGC community. Overall my results at big live events have been pretty mediocre this season, but I had a lot of fun with this format and love writing about VGC so I wanted to share a little on the teams I used. This format was extremely different to past formats I had played such as VGC15' and 16' so I would say it was very difficult for me to adapt to the new format, and to be completely honest I actually really disliked it early on. However, as we progressed through the year and I found teams I really enjoyed playing it actually grew on me quite a lot, and despite my worse performances at events compared to 2016 I actually had a lot of fun with this metagame.
