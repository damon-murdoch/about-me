I've been messing with this team for a little while, and it has been excellent for practising with rain and has demonstrated how strong rain can be in the current metagame when unchecked, or its counters are played around effectively. 

This team was inspired by a a team I faced in the first round of a Brisbane Bisharps tournament in August used by Paulo, which featured Mega Metagross and Politoed. His team also had Defiant Braviary, but I decided against using that on my team :^)

Generally the focus for this team is dealing a lot of damage with my offensive pokemon, and if I still have three or four of my pokemon left against their two I set up perish song with Politoed. I usually close up the game by using Amoonguss and Politoed to rage powder + perish song, double protect, double switch and double protect.
