Hi! Iâ€™m Damon, also known as SirScrubbington in the Pokemon community. VGC, or the Pokemon Video Game Championships is the official competitive format for Pokemon and has official live events held frequently around the world.

VGC is one of the most exciting aspects of Pokemon, as it plays very differently to other eSports and live events are a fun opportunity to meet up with friends, play some games and maybe even win some prize money or a trip to the world championships! However,  competitive Pokemon (Especially VGC) has a high barrier for entry, with respect to having to memorise and learn a lot of complicated game related mechanics, learnsets and stats.

This article is here to make that job a little bit easier, and will discuss the most common things you'll need to know to get playing as soon as possible as well as a lot of teams to help you learn the metagame of Pokemon VGC.

If you would like to read the full report, please check it out on my Pokemon blog [here](http://sir-scrubbington.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/02/22/224858).
