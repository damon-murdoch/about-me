Hey guys! I’m back again with another writeup, this time about the teams I used in the VGC2018 format. Despite my lack of results, I really enjoyed playing in this format for the most part and found teambuilding to be really interesting. It reminded me a lot of my first VGC format, 2015 but it also had major differences which set it apart from other formats. While it was not without its problems, including fun factors such as Ally Switch and broken Z-Moves I felt it was an enjoyable format and I’m writing this report to document some of the teams which I made for and used during the 2018 season. I won't be able to provide dates for each of these events as it is difficult to pinpoint due to my lack of twitter activity for most of the season and Facebook deleting old event pages after awhile. Sorry for the inconvenience!
