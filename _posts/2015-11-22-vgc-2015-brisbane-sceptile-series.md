Hey guys! This is the team I used to win the Brisbane Sceptile Series Premier Challenge #2. Throughout the day I faced a number of really interesting teams, and played some really great games! I was very happy with the team, and incredibly satisfied with my final result! The team is a modified version of the team I had used the previous week, although unfortunately I came 11th and missed making cut during that event. In this post I will write about my team, the teambuilding process and my tournament run.
